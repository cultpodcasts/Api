But it\u0027s not stupid. It\u0027s tapping into something powerful, because it\u0027s shameful. Vance\u0027s fantasy that childless cat ladies are miserable in their lives is another case of every accusation being a projection. In actuality, he\u0027s speaking to that swath of parents out there in general\u2014and particularly on the right\u2014who are actually miserable in their lives, regretting their choices, wondering why God saddled them with 4-5-6 kids in a country that does so little to support families. But it\u0027s illegal to say any of this. Children are gifts from God, right? They have to disown it \u0026 pretend that their families are perfect \u0026 perfectly fulfilling. An editorial-style Brief from Matthew, who\u0027s been parenting as a stepdad \u0026 biodad for long enough to know that parents \u0026 the childless absolutely need each other.

They express excitement about returning to solo episodes, reflecting on their past interviews with various religious guests \u0026 sharing their distinct approaches to social media. The main topic centers on \u0027Christian outrage,\u0027 sparked by a viral Instagram reel featuring Nathan\u0027s provocative statement, \u0027I am God, you are God, we are God,\u0027 which garnered over 2,600 comments. The hosts humorously read \u0026 react to the outraged responses, including accusations of blasphemy \u0026 threats of divine punishment, while reminiscing about their own experiences with fear-based religious teachings. They transition to discussing the backlash against the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, criticizing the organizers for apologizing \u0026 lauding France\u0027s secular traditions. The conversation shifts to potential civil unrest in the US, which they believe would manifest as isolated incidents rather than a full-scale war, driven by fear-mongering rhetoric. They also touch on political commentary, expressing support for Kamala Harris despite her controversial past, \u0026 discussing her stance on abortion rights \u0026 the Israel-Gaza conflict. The hosts emphasize the importance of holding all leaders accountable, likening political performance to their podcast. Briefly, they address the underpayment of Olympic athletes before engaging in a playful game of Mario Kart 64, where Zach emerges victorious. Wrapping up, they seek listener feedback on their political discussions, mention upcoming merchandise, outline their guest interview approach, \u0026 explain their podcast schedule, all while maintaining a casual, humorous tone filled with personal anecdotes.

These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, \u0026 money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning \u0026 guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper \u0026 darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times \u0026 speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, \u0026 his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views \u0026 subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle.

Jones was known for his alleged prophetic visions, dreams, \u0026 involvement with the Kansas City Prophets \u0026 the International House of Prayer (IHOP) in Kansas City. His ministry was marked by claims of supernatural experiences \u0026 guiding the future of the New Apostolic Reformation. Similarly, Branham, revered as a powerful prophet in American history, had a ministry filled with detailed prophecies, many of which were believed to be accurate by his followers. Both men shared histories of claimed supernatural experiences \u0026 struggles with mental health, which they described as encounters with the divine. The transcript delves into the controversial nature of their ministries, highlighting allegations of misconduct, false prophecies, \u0026 connections to occult practices. Jones\u0027 influence on Mike Bickle \u0026 the Kansas City Fellowship is evident as he convinced Bickle of grand prophetic visions \u0026 a new order of Christianity. Branham\u0027s legacy in the Latter Rain movement \u0026 his connections to questionable figures like the Ku Klux Klan are explored, showing how his doctrines influenced subsequent charismatic leaders. The blending of metaphysical beliefs with Christian teachings \u0026 the perpetuation of failed prophecies by both Jones \u0026 Branham underscore the contentious aspects of their ministries. 00:00 Introduction 00:15 Mike Bickle Praising William Branham 01:00 Bob Jones \u0026 the Kansas City Prophets 01:46 Bob Jones\u0027 Alleged Sinful Past \u0026 Parallels to Branham 02:35 Leadership Issues \u0026 Ignored Misconduct 03:00 Sexual Misconduct Allegations in Bickle\u0027s Ministry 03:54 Bob Jones\u0027 Influence on Mike Bickle 04:52 Jones\u0027 Alleged Visions \u0026 New Order of Christianity 05:37 Controversies \u0026 Occult Practices 06:30 Jones\u0027 Energy Transference Beliefs 07:00 Failed Prophecies \u0026 the Stock Market Crash 07:50 Recreating Branham\u0027s Ministry \u0026 Stage Persona 08:25 Branham\u0027s Revival History \u0026 Controversial Associations 09:00 The Angel \u0027Emma\u0027 \u0026 Revival Influences 09:50 Manifest Sons of God Doctrine \u0026 End Times Army 10:20 References ______________________ \u2013 Support the channel: https://www.patreon.com/branham \u2013 Subscribe to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSpezVG15TVG-lOYMRXuyQ \u2013 Visit the website: https://william-branham.org \u2013 Follow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamBranhamOrg \u2013 Follow on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@william.m.branham \u2013 Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/wmbhr \u2013 Buy the books: https://william-branham.org/site/books","length":"00:11:48","release":"2024-08-01T19:00:20Z","spotify":null,"apple":null,"youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVRRfIPAQSA","subjects":["William M.

With 44 siblings, a \u0027Wayman\u0027 was just about every person he knew in his life. Even more taxing than his childhood trauma, was the trauma he experienced as an adult when he escaped at 30 years old. His life turned upside down\u2014 with the threat of his eternal salvation in jeopardy, while fighting against everything he was taught to believe, \u0026 on top of that being shunned \u0026 accosted by his loved ones\u2014 things came to a head for Calvin when he returned to see his Father on his death bed.

In today\u0027s episode, we had the pleasure of sitting down with Mike Wendling, a national digital reporter for the BBC who specializes in covering disinformation \u0026 conspiracy theories. Mike shared some truly eye-opening insights from his experiences investigating far-right extremist groups in the US. We delved into the complex web of conspiracy theories surrounding major events \u0026 how they\u0027re exploited to politically radicalize people. It was sobering to hear how fringe ideas, once confined to the darkest corners of the internet, are now being laundered into mainstream political talking points by media pundits \u0026 elected officials alike. Mike\u0027s firsthand accounts of the Proud Boys \u0026 Oath Keepers revealed the contradictory nature of these groups. This episode highlighted the critical need for responsible journalism to combat the insidious spread of disinformation in our society.

I am German \u0026 indigenous Mexico descendant. 59 years old Have/ had 2 children, Lost a son, he was sixteen \u0026 my mother at a double homicide in 2002. My mother \u0026 step father raised me Baptist \u0026 non denominational, but went to pentecostal with my neighbor friends. Mom taught me religious biblical texts. As an young 20 year old I started searching for truth. Some sort of religion to save me from abuse I endured at the hands of my step father. My brother \u0026 myself had endured to be more exact. My mother was emotionally abused. I went to many other denominations before Jehovahs witnesses. In 1985 I study books \u0026 Bible with Jehovahs witnesses. I thought they were decent people \u0026 they taught me God hates violence. 32 years later, I learned that misogyny, hidden child abuse, domestic violence wS permitted in that organization. Victims were told to not tell anyone of any abuse \u0026 bible says you have to stay with abusers. However, for me I escaped 3 times because I didn\u0027t agree. I almost died at the hand of my children\u0027s father. 1987. Over the years from my 20\u0027s, 30\u0027s, 40\u0027s \u0026 early 50\u0027s I would leave Jws, go back, leave, go back. . But as of today sine 2019 my journey has stopped completely with Jehovahs Witnesses. The only Journey I have now is freedom from a controlling cult since 2019. I can choose dreams \u0026 goals with no guilt if displeasing there god that punishes all who don\u0027t conform. I look at our lives, my life as a beautiful flowing river. Each flow of water moves \u0026 turns in the bends of a river. Sometimes a river slows or trickles along the way until the next strong rain fall. All the movement in a free flowing river is my life. When a log or large rocks are in the flow of the river, it\u0027s my life \u0026 the obstacles or change of path that I need to choose to move. Over rocks or large boulders are just what water does, it flows over, around \u0026 under to keep moving. My healing journey from childhood abuse \u0026 religious abuse was the large boulders in my path of life. At times my river of life did not flow well. It stopped if my decisions were not the best. But once I realized I had to keep moving, nothing could stand in my way. I choose to help others to keep moving on there river of life. That\u0027s why I started sharing some of my life on different forms. I love to share kind \u0026 caring words to help others. We cannot stop living because others try to suppress who we are. Our lives are beutiful, we have \u0026 can have a free flowing spirit within. I have seen in my travels, especially Oregon,...great beauty. And, large rivers make me feel alive. They shimmer in the sun. Life flurishes in a beautiful free flowing body of water. When we recognize in ourselves, \u0027 Hey I need to heal,\u0027 then that person who was in pain releases that block of large boulders from our lives, then the living starts again. Just looking at life in that perspective has Givin me a more renewed sense of loving. Nature in all it\u0027s glory can teach us to live again, no matter what part in our life has slowed down, or is trickling slowly....it can come alive again, it will start moving once we can \u0026 will decide to journey on \u0026 not let obstacles keep us down. Life is to precious to stop living. Leave your logs \u0026 rapids \u0026 water falls behind. Start your river again, let it shine \u0026 let life begin.

This clash between free-thinking scholars \u0026 conservative leaders like Joseph Fielding Smith led to attempts at excommunication, spy infiltration, \u0026 the firing of liberal educators. Amidst this tension, Church President David O. McKay emerged as an unexpected protector of intellectual freedom. The period also saw the church grappling with civil rights issues \u0026 racial policies, as public pressure forced leaders to confront their teachings. This tumultuous era set the stage for decades of struggle between faith, scholarship, \u0026 authority in Mormonism.","length":"02:39:45","release":"2024-07-31T18:00:00Z","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/255PqNIu1RyeUlkCIoIyls","apple":"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/church-educators-fired-for-opposing-mormon-racism-ep-1923/id312094772?i=1000663952823","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDB1lINIhoU","subjects":["The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints"]},{"episodeId":"1a11b3fc-cb8e-4838-8440-09ea88035a05","podcastName":"The Divorcing Religion Podcast","episodeTitle":"Britt Hartley - No Nonsense Spirituality","episodeDescription":"Britt Hartley - No Nonsense Spirituality Divorced: Mormonism My guest today is author, nihilism survivor, \u0026 atheist spiritual advisor Britt Hartley.

Using church history, Scriptural reasoning, \u0026 even analysis of Russian Christian nationalism. The book argues that another gospel, (which is actually not the gospel at all), has colonized American evangelicalism, explaining that decolonization requires a renewal of the Church\u0027s own gospel-centered political vision. Joel delves into the complexities of Christian nationalism, its impact on American evangelicalism, \u0026 the theological arguments against it. He shares insights from his book, discusses the importance of community, \u0026 reflects on the upcoming 2024 election\u0027s potential consequences for evangelical identity. Throughout the episode, Rachel \u0026 Joel explore the nuances of Christian nationalism \u0026 the importance of differentiating its various definitions.

We examine how early influences, particularly from figures like William Branham \u0026 Jane Lead, have shaped modern teachings in these movements. They delve into the blending of Christian \u0026 New Age ideas, particularly focusing on concepts like the Manifest Sons of God, eschatological perfection, \u0026 the so-called sacred purge. The episode highlights the significant overlaps between New Age beliefs \u0026 the teachings of the NAR, suggesting a convergence of these streams of thought over time. John \u0026 Steve emphasize the dangers of these converging apostate teachings, particularly how they manipulate biblical texts to promote elitist \u0026 often harmful ideologies. The discussion also touches on the historical contexts that have allowed these ideas to proliferate, including the influence of Christian Identity teachings \u0026 their racist underpinnings. By tracing the development of these movements \u0026 their shared themes, the hosts aim to shed light on the complex web of doctrines that have influenced modern Pentecostal \u0026 charismatic movements, urging listeners to critically examine these teachings in light of their historical \u0026 ideological origins.

We\u0027re ending the fifth season. There are 5 seasons of Uncertain. There\u0027s also over a hundred episodes. That\u0027s a really big deal. I was planning to sort of end the season with the episode from last week with Janai Amon talking about the How to prepare for telling your story publicly in a safe way. I was really excited about that episode. I was prepared to end on that episode. And then I met with the board of directors for tears of Eden. Yes, we have a [00:01:00] board of directors. We are a nonprofit. All non profits have a board of directors, \u0026 I was really thrilled that they suggested, hey, why don\u0027t we do like a final celebratory episode in which we, the board, interview you, Katherine, about the journey we\u0027re on. with Uncertain. And I honestly was so in the zone of like, okay, I need to finish the season. I need to wrap it up. I need to get everything out. I need to do the promo \u0026 I need to do the recording \u0026 I need to do the editing \u0026 just kind of full on just work task mode. And so the fact that the board suggested, hey, let\u0027s do an episode to sort of commemorate \u0026 celebrate. That was really helpful. I really appreciated it.

This doctrine teaches that faith, positive speech, \u0026 donations can lead to financial \u0026 physical blessings. Copeland\u0027s ministry has a global reach through television, radio broadcasts, books, \u0026 international crusades. He has built significant political ties, notably supporting former President Donald Trump \u0026 serving on Trump\u0027s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board. Copeland\u0027s wealth \u0026 influence are substantial, with a headquarters featuring an extensive campus, a private airstrip, \u0026 luxury properties. His personal lifestyle, including owning multiple private jets, has drawn scrutiny \u0026 criticism, yet his teachings continue to attract a large following. Copeland\u0027s rise in the evangelical world is closely tied to the Latter Rain movement of the late 1940s, which emphasized the restoration of apostolic gifts such as healing \u0026 prophecy. Influenced by figures like William Branham \u0026 Oral Roberts, Copeland incorporated elements of the Latter Rain movement into his ministry.

episode of the Cults \u0026 the Culting of America podcast, hosts Scot Loyd \u0026 Daniella Mestyanek Young dive into the concept of the \u0027sacred assumption,\u0027 a core belief that underpins a cult\u0027s worldview. Daniella explains how cult leaders create \u0026 manipulate these worldviews to control their followers, emphasizing that these assumptions don\u0027t have to be religious but can revolve around power, status, or other ideals. The discussion touches on the similarities \u0026 differences between cults \u0026 religions, the manipulation tactics used by cult leaders, \u0026 the challenges of deconstructing these beliefs after leaving a cult. Daniella also shares personal anecdotes about her experiences with the Children of God cult \u0026 the US Army, highlighting the parallels between different high-control groups. Scot \u0026 Daniella discuss the ongoing process of deconstruction, the importance of questioning sacred assumptions, \u0026 the impact of privilege \u0026 societal constructs on our beliefs. They emphasize the need for skepticism \u0026 self-defined values, contrasting this with the often rigid \u0026 manipulative frameworks of cults. The episode concludes with a call to action for listeners to engage with Daniella\u0027s work, including her book Uncultured \u0026 her Patreon project UnAmerican.

I\u0027m your host, Scot Loyd. Welcome to another episode of Cults \u0026 the Culting of America. I\u0027m Scot Loyd, along with my friend Daniella Mestyanek Young. Not only is she my friend, but she is a scholar of cults, extreme groups, \u0026 extremely bad leadership. Daniella, how are you doing today? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** I am doing great. I am excited for us to talk about the worldview shift into the transcendent mission \u0026 the most common question anyone gets asked about cults, which is: what is the difference between a cult \u0026 a religion? **Scot Loyd:** Very nicely said. I\u0027m looking forward to this episode. And you\u0027re wearing an interesting shirt today. Tell us about that shirt, \u0026 if folks want to buy one for themselves or their friends \u0026 family, how can they do that? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, you can find any of the shirts you see me wearing through the links below. I sell them through my social media channels. This shirt says, \u0027The first rule of cults is you\u0027re never in a cult,\u0027 which is the epigraph of my book, *Uncultured*. It\u0027s about growing up in the Children of God \u0026 joining the US Army. It\u0027s also a play on *Fight Club*, which a lot of people don\u0027t realize is kind of the cult movie. It really gets to the idea that nobody thinks they\u0027re in a cult. Cults are manipulative cons that target people, lie, deflect, \u0026 pull you into their worldview. As soon as you realize you\u0027re in a cult, you\u0027re on your way out. But many people think cults are extreme \u0026 rare, when in fact, they\u0027re incredibly common. A lot of my life\u0027s work is pointing out these parallels \u0026 helping people understand the groups \u0026 systems we\u0027re in. **Scot Loyd:** And we\u0027re going down the list of characteristics of a cult that you have identified \u0026 authored. Today we arrive at the idea of worldview, or as you call it, the sacred assumption. What do you mean by sacred assumption, \u0026 why is it a leading characteristic of a cult? **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Oh my gosh, this one is so dramatic. I mean, literally, I was in bed \u0026 I sat up \u0026 just yelled out, \u0027Hold nothing sacred.\u0027 It was the answer to the question I\u0027d been asked for 15 years: Why would anyone join a cult? How can people fall for such extremism? Growing up in the Children of God, which was a pedophile cult, it was perfectly understandable how it happened, but difficult to explain to outsiders. First, let me bring this back to that common question: what is the difference between a cult \u0026 a religion? This ties into worldview. People ask this all the time, \u0026 I say they\u0027re not even the same type of thing. A religion is an idea, a noun. A cult is a group. You need a group, even if it\u0027s just 2 people. One of the most pernicious stereotypes is that cults are religious. Every day I see people saying, \u0027Nah, not a cult, because we\u0027re not religious.\u0027 Part of why NXIVM fooled so many people is because it wasn\u0027t religious. Large group awareness training, like est or anything ending in \u0027-ony,\u0027 aren\u0027t religious but can still be cults. A cult doesn\u0027t give you a religion; it gives you a worldview. The leader spends decades forming this worldview, \u0026 to be a member, you must adopt it. It\u0027s not presented that way, but it becomes clear once you\u0027re in it. The entire worldview is upheld by the sacred assumption. In the Children of God, it was that this random white dude who failed at everything was the prophet of God. As long as you believe that, you can justify anything. The sacred assumption ties closely to the \u0027ends justify the means\u0027 mentality \u0026 sometimes even precipitates an apocalyptic mindset. **Scot Loyd:** The sacred assumption doesn\u0027t necessarily have to be theological in nature. It could be anything related to life, like pursuing wealth, status, or power. That\u0027s what a lot of these groups offer \u2013 a world change, a fulfilling life, or a flourishing existence. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Right. In NXIVM, the sacred assumption was that Keith Raniere was the smartest man on earth. In the US Army, the sacred assumption is that the US flag is worth dying for. You must believe that to be successful in the Army. So, it doesn\u0027t have to be religious. It\u0027s a worldview. I\u0027ve recently realized all cults \u0026 cult leaders promise \u0027space travel,\u0027 meaning ultimate enlightenment or achievement will be on another plane, another existence, another life, a different heavenly body \u2013 something that can\u0027t be proven. This keeps people from achieving enlightenment because if it were real, they\u0027d leave. It\u0027s a crucial part of the con \u0026 makes it hard to crack people\u0027s brainwashing. As long as you choose to believe the sacred assumption, you can justify anything. **Scot Loyd:** When you talk about this sacred assumption or worldview, it reminds me of Aristotle\u0027s idea that to be persuasive, you need parts of your message that are familiar \u0026 parts that are novel. If it\u0027s all novelty, people are likely to reject it. But if there\u0027s something familiar at the core, it resonates with people. Cult leaders leverage these familiar sacred assumptions that people are already familiar with to control their thoughts \u0026 behavior. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, \u0026 I think this is exactly what Taylor Swift means when she says, \u0027You know how to ball, I know Aristotle.\u0027 She\u0027s dropping lines because she knows how to pull emotional strings. Cult leaders know how to manipulate you by leveraging these familiar concepts. I don\u0027t agree with the stereotype that cult leaders start off good \u0026 then turn bad. Cult leaders don\u0027t trip \u0026 fall into coercive control. They\u0027ve been figuring this out for a long time. For example, Jim Jones was studying how to manipulate people with preacher voice from a young age. He never cared about civil rights; it was just his way to stand out. This is why religion is often used \u2013 it\u0027s a pre-existing worldview with a giant body of literature \u0026 concepts that a cult leader can tweak \u0026 spin to fit their agenda. They use these frameworks to radicalize people. Religions have thought-stopping clich\u00E9s built in, where at some point, logic ceases, \u0026 you go forward on faith. Nefarious leaders who have been honing their manipulative skills know how to use that. **Scot Loyd:** Right. And the thought-stopping clich\u00E9 is, \u0027God told me to do this.\u0027 When someone plays that card, how do you come back from it? You don\u0027t. There\u0027s nothing you can say if they claim to have heard from God. Cult leaders play on these collective questions we all have about origin, destiny, meaning, morality, \u0026 purpose. They offer answers with certainty, enthusiasm, \u0026 passion. The human dynamic often makes us fall in line \u0026 not question these sacred assumptions. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Absolutely. And deconstruction tip, Scot, can you repeat that list? We need to make sure this is in the show notes. **Scot Loyd:** Sure. The list is origin (where did I come from?), destiny (where am I going?), meaning (what does it all mean?), morality (how do we treat one another?), \u0026 purpose (what should I do with my life?). **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** These are the huge questions you have to define for yourself when you leave a cult. You\u0027re rejecting a worldview. My three-part model of deconstruction is: first, wake up \u0026 physically \u0026 mentally leave the cult; second, spend about a decade understanding why you were in a cult \u0026 its impact on your personality \u0026 identity; \u0026 third, move forward with no models. It\u0027s overwhelming because you\u0027ve lost your framework \u0026 have to answer these giant questions. This is why we\u0027re at risk of cult-hopping afterward, looking for another system with black-and-white rules. I fell into CrossFit \u0026 paleo for a while because I was looking for another system to live by. **Scot Loyd:** I\u0027ve experienced that too. My deconstruction is still ongoing. I left the United Pentecostal Church in a slow fade. I went through stages of cult-hopping, embracing different theological perspectives, \u0026 coming to terms with the idea that I was exceptional. I had to realize that if I\u0027m special, that\u0027s something I define for myself. Likely, I\u0027m just like everyone else, trying to make it through life \u0026 determine what is good, how to treat one another, \u0026 how to get along. The sacred assumption regulates behavior, but we need autonomy over our lives. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Exactly, Scot. We build these stories to control behavior. Classic fairy tales were scary to keep children safe. The stories we tell ourselves are critical to how we act \u0026 operate. One thing to watch out for is groups with anti-gossip policies. Gossip helps us warn each other about bad actors. These stories \u0026 worldviews are crucial, \u0026 it\u0027s not as simple as discarding them. It takes a decade or more to build your own worldview after leaving a cult. We need to understand why we were in a cult \u0026 its impact on our identity before building our worldview. **Scot Loyd:** Yes, like you, I was born into the United Pentecostal Church \u0026 invested a large part of my life in it. Education was my way out. One of the most fascinating books I read early on was Foucault\u0027s *Discipline \u0026 Punish*, about the evolution of prisons. He opens with an assassin trying to kill King Louis XVI. The public execution made people rebel, so prisons were designed to regulate behavior. The panopticon\u0027s design, where prisoners think they\u0027re being watched 24/7, became a model for schools \u0026 hospitals. It\u0027s a beautiful analogy for high-control groups. The sacred assumption regulates behavior, dictating every aspect of life. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, \u0026 military deployment is like a prison sentence in many ways. Initially, it\u0027s nice not to have to handle daily tasks, but eventually, you crave autonomy. People want clarity, which cults provide during social confusion. Recording my audiobook made me realize culty things about myself 20 years after leaving the cult. I had to audition for the audiobook \u0026 was convinced only I could do it. When I got the offer, I was paralyzed with fear, needing professional validation. This made me realize I had been seeking a mentor to tell me what to do with my life, which isn\u0027t a mentor; it\u0027s a leader. **Scot Loyd:** Exactly, Daniella. I still seek validation \u0026 apologize for everything, a holdover from conditioning in the United Pentecostal Church. The sacred assumption gives us something to aspire to, standing in for the leader\u0027s gaze. It\u0027s terrifying to make decisions on your own, but we\u0027re all just trying to figure out how to live our one life. Your book, *Uncultured*, was your way of making your pain meaningful, helping others with their journeys. Realizing we\u0027re not as different or special as we think is a poignant part of deconstruction. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, \u0026 the realization that we\u0027re all in this together, without sacred assumptions keeping us apart, is crucial. Leaders proclaiming sacred assumptions discourage questions. Offering certainty in a volatile world is appealing but unrealistic. Sacred assumptions offer a selfish worldview, ignoring global perspectives. When you see an \u0027us vs. them\u0027 mentality, question it. It\u0027s built into cult language, with groups claiming moral superiority. **Scot Loyd:** Absolutely. Cult leaders use familiar values \u0026 frameworks to radicalize people. Your Ten Commandments for good groups, like holding nothing sacred, counteract this. Values can be manipulated; it\u0027s the reporting you require that shows true values. For example, if safety is a company\u0027s stated value, but they focus on loss numbers, they\u0027re not prioritizing safety. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Exactly. And to preempt trolls who say, \u0027not holding anything sacred\u0027 is my sacred assumption \u2013 approaching beliefs with skepticism is essential. I show this in *Uncultured* at a soldier\u0027s funeral, holding doubt that our side is 100% right. General McChrystal\u0027s book, *Leaders: Myth \u0026 Reality*, emphasizes that soldiers must admit they don\u0027t know for sure they\u0027re on the side of right. **Scot Loyd:** And this idea of binary thinking \u2013 right vs. wrong, good vs. bad \u2013 is problematic. Our lives are shaped by luck \u0026 circumstances. The arrogance of assuming we\u0027re right \u0026 others are wrong is staggering. Living humbly means recognizing the complexities \u0026 uncertainties of life. **Daniella Mestyanek Young:** Yes, deconstruction is about becoming less narcissistic \u0026 more selfish in a healthy way. Recognizing privilege \u0026 the accident of birth is crucial. There\u0027s no meritocracy; success isn\u0027t guaranteed by doing everything right. Grasping sacred assumptions is a con. **Scot Loyd:** Well said, Daniella. On that note, we\u0027ll conclude this fascinating conversation. I encourage our listeners \u0026 viewers to pick up Daniella\u0027s book, *Uncultured*, read it, \u0026 share it with friends.

Warren Jeffs, once the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), turned a religious group into a frightening cult.

Jeffs had total control \u0026 frightened everyone. He was eventually caught by the police \u0026 put on trial. Evidence showed he did terrible things, like abusing young girls, which he wrongly called \u0027heavenly sessions.\u0027 Listen in as we uncover the shocking details, psychological analysis, \u0026 the pursuit of justice that continues to this day.

Welcome to the Just Dumb Enough Podcast. A show that acknowledges no one is always an expert, by dispelling misconceptions with real experts. My guest today is Gabriel Milon. Gabriel was born into a very famous Christianity based cult, \u0026 by the time he tried to make a normal life: He had to rebuild who he was from the ground up. It\u0027s not all black cloaks \u0026 daggers with human sacrifice, but it is an absolutely enlightening \u0026 engaging story, so stick around! ( Www.MagicMind.Com/JustDumb20 - Code: Dumb20 ) Let\u0027s be careful with who we call Grandpa! This story of escape \u0026 a successful life after is really something that makes me feel good \u0026 hopeful, but for as much as we touched on: There is hours more content about the darkness \u0026 depravity behind the Children of God cult. Honestly, I don\u0027t think there is a solid reason for this show to dive into the worst of the worst. If you found this episode entertaining, use it as a springboard to seek out other shows like \u0027Last Podcast on the Left\u0027 who did a full 5 part series on the inner workings. In other news, July is almost over \u0026 the rankings have updated just a little: 1. The United States, now led by New York, California, \u0026 Texas. 2. England of the United Kingdom. 3. Canada, led by Ontario, with British Columbia trying to catch up last minute. 4. Australia, with New South Wales holding a lead, \u0026 Victoria trailing behind. 5. Ghana, overtaking New Zealand this week. It\u0027s a tight race as we close up the month in a few days. That\u0027s it for this week!

Expecting her experience to be one based on love \u0026 service, Rian was instead met with strict rules, surveillance, \u0026 spiritual turmoil as she continually felt forced to act against her own conscience \u0026 integrity. As the oppressive atmosphere coupled with isolation due to the initial rise of COVID began to take its toll on her mental \u0026 physical health, Rian cherished her weekly calls with her family. That is, until her family\u0027s mounting concern for Rian\u0027s welfare coincided with their loss of faith in the church. As Rian battled depression \u0026 suicidal thoughts, her mission leaders\u0027 response was shocking: accusations of pride \u0026 instructions to cut ties with her doubting family. Certain that their concern for Rian\u0027s spiritual well-being was superior to the love her \u0027fallen\u0027 family had to offer back home, her Mission President \u0026 his wife insert themselves as surrogate parents for the remainder of her mission \u0026 beyond. Despite this initial interference, Rian finds herself facing her own faith crisis. As she considers what the actions of her \u0027mission parents\u0027 truly cost her, Rian discovers for herself the real meaning of family, \u0026 her family had it all along.","length":"03:58:20","release":"2024-07-29T18:00:00Z","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4lFU14SiVtrQ0rexnc9crx","apple":"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/my-mormon-mission-gave-me-ptsd-rian-anderson-ep-1922/id312094772?i=1000663710969","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKOi__7R8Po","subjects":["The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints","Psychology"]},{"episodeId":"19b77f28-27c7-4446-9dc2-be46e25883b2","podcastName":"Apostle David E.

He has managed to enthrall millions to think God is on Trump\u0027s side. All I can say is that no one has experienced more directly the weaponization of the DOJ using former AG William Barr, than Michael Cohen. His book Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized the Department of Justice Against His Critics. So I decided to reair our 2023 interview when the book first came out to put some \u0027flesh on the bones\u0027 of this attack on our constitution \u0026 rule of law. Michael Cohen hosts the Mea Culpa podcast \u0026 authored the #1 best-selling book, Disloyal: A Memoir. His book Revenge is an indictment of Trump weaponizing the Department of Justice, headed by AG Bill Barr. Putting Cohen in jail- solitary confinement for 51 days!

Well Dan \u0026 Angela show the mechanics of how to make your faith work for you using real examples from their own lives. They share how we have to first change our belief system programmed into us, how they managed to do that themselves \u0026 how it will work for you too - if the same steps are followed (changing your mind). This is well mapped out with scriptures that you may have never seen before. We were taught to not want for anything more than \u0027sustenance \u0026 covering\u0027 \u0026 to feel guilty if we do (want more for ourselves). Well, the scriptures prove that God clearly does want more for us \u0026 that all of these promises (and God\u0027s wishes for us) are clearly spelled out. Great change for you can be just around the corner. Do you want change? Check it out.

This strategy allowed independent charismatic ministries to support one another while functioning autonomously. Critics outside the NAR express concern over the perceived abandonment of sound theology \u0026 the spread of false doctrines, as leaders with limited theological understanding introduce extra-biblical themes. The NAR aims to create an Endtime Revival to claim dominion over various Christian denominations \u0026 non-Christians, focusing on pop culture \u0026 democratic individualism. The movement\u0027s networking strategy involves re-evaluating past Christian practices to bring about a global revival, essentially rewriting the DNA of Christianity. The NAR\u0027s development into a social movement can be traced back to the Social Gospel, which merged church \u0026 politics to address social issues. Figures like Charles Oliver Brown \u0026 Washington Gladden laid the groundwork for this movement, with Baptist theologian Walter Rauschenbusch furthering its theological framework. C. Peter Wagner, a key figure in the NAR, built upon the Social Gospel concepts, introducing the idea of engaging in spiritual warfare against demonic forces. Wagner\u0027s portrayal of the NAR as a militant band of spiritual warriors has led to controversy \u0026 violence, as members adopt an insiders versus outsiders mentality. The NAR\u0027s objective to claim dominion over societal spheres involves establishing a strongly networked presence within them, although this has raised concerns about the movement\u0027s influence on political \u0026 social changes. 00:00 Introduction 00:17 Networking Strategy \u0026 Growth 02:56 Historical Context of Social Gospel 04:47 Influence of Henry George \u0026 Social Reform 06:51 C.

Born into the faith, Karinne was the youngest in her family \u0026 often seen as the \u0027black sheep.\u0027 From the tender age of five, she endured abuse from church members, only to be dismissed \u0026 disbelieved by her mother \u0026 the congregation when she bravely spoke out. Karinne\u0027s adolescence was turbulent, marked by multiple departures from \u0026 returns to the group, each time accompanied by the harsh reality of being disfellowshipped. Ultimately, her breaking point came when faced with the organization\u0027s teaching that she must choose death over allowing her child to receive a life-saving blood transfusion. This heart-wrenching directive propelled Karinne to leave the faith for good, prioritizing the safety \u0026 protection of her child. Despite the hardships, Karinne ends her interview on a hopeful note, offering words of encouragement to others who have left the organization \u0026 are struggling to find their place in the world. Join us for an insightful \u0026 emotional conversation that sheds light on the complexities of life within \u0026 beyond Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses.

Raised within the church, Sandra\u0027s early life was deeply rooted in the values \u0026 practices of the Holdeman community. She shares the love \u0026 nurturing she received from her adoptive parents, highlighting her father\u0027s caring nature \u0026 her mother\u0027s intelligence \u0026 strength. Sandra discusses the complex feelings she experienced growing up in the Holdeman church. Despite her deep connection to her family \u0026 faith, she sometimes struggled with the strictures of the religious environment. These moments of anger \u0026 confusion were tempered by her belief in divine providence\u2014a protective, guiding force she felt directed her life. Sandra eloquently describes how this sense of spiritual guidance helped her reconcile her past struggles with her present understanding of purpose \u0026 destiny. Sandra also shares poignant stories from her time in the church, including being disallowed from speaking to girls for years after someone accused her of homosexuality. This accusation led to severe social ostracism, which deeply affected her mental \u0026 emotional well-being. Despite the harsh judgment \u0026 alienation, Sandra found strength within herself, drawing on her inner resilience to navigate these difficult times. Throughout the episode, Sandra reflects on her life beyond the Holdeman church. She \u0026 her husband, also raised in the Holdeman faith, built a life together, raising 2 daughters \u0026 enjoying the blessings of 2 grandchildren.

These depositions show the true depths of David E. Taylor \u0026 Michelle Brannons\u0027 scams, lies, \u0026 money laundering operation they are running through their cult. David is using religion to manipulate people emotionally, sexually, spiritually \u0026 financially. Over the last 33 years David E. Taylor has used his cunning \u0026 guile to double cross brainwashed followers into giving him hundreds of millions of dollars so he can live his lavish lifestyle. However, there is a deeper \u0026 darker dynamic to this very dangerous religous cult that needs to be examined under a microscope. One of the reasons being, David still makes claims to this day that he has seen Jesus well over a 1,000 times \u0026 speaks to god on a daily basis. David also claims he has healed cancer, raised the dead, healed the sick, grown back severed limbs, \u0026 his most outrageous claim that he cleared an entire hospitals of sick people. These claims of course are all baseless that have absolutely no scientific proof or proof from doctors to validate these occurrences. Youtube is allowing David operate his money laundering scam by letting him purchase his views \u0026 subscribers on the platform, thus he continues to manipulate people into donating their last dollar to him so that he can fund a lavish lifestyle.
